# UX Review & Optimization Plan

## Design Inspiration Analysis

### Rainbow.me (Heavy)
- **Bold gradients** - Purple/pink/blue combinations
- **Large typography** - Headlines are huge and impactful
- **Interactive previews** - Show actual app UI mockups
- **Fun but professional** - Playful but trustworthy
- **Strong color contrast** - Dark backgrounds with bright accents
- **Clear CTAs** - Big download buttons, obvious next steps

### Testimonials.to (Light)
- **Minimalist** - Clean, lots of white space
- **Typography-focused** - Text is the hero
- **Subtle animations** - Smooth but not distracting
- **Proof-focused** - Testimonials take center stage

## Dark Mode Consideration

**Should we use dark mode?**
- ✅ **YES** - Fits the "grind" aesthetic, modern, less eye strain
- ✅ Delivery drivers often work nights - dark mode is practical
- ✅ Makes colorful badges/gradients pop more
- ✅ More premium feel

**Recommendation:** **Dark mode with colorful accents**
